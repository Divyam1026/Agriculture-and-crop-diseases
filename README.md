Welcome to the Agriculture Crop Disease Identifier! This web application aims to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in identifying crop diseases and providing solutions through a series of questions.

### Features

## Crop Disease Identification

Our website employs an intelligent system that guides users through a series of questions about their crops' symptoms, growing conditions, and other relevant factors. Based on the user's responses, the system identifies the potential crop disease affecting their crops.

## Tailored Solutions

After identifying the crop disease, our system provides tailored solutions and recommendations to help users manage and mitigate the impact of the disease on their crops. These solutions are based on best practices and expert knowledge in the field of agriculture.

## Comprehensive Database

Our website includes a comprehensive database of common crop diseases, symptoms, causes, and management techniques. Users can browse through the database to learn more about specific diseases and access additional resources for further information.
